            Enterprises can monitor global news for specific risks or events that concern their business. Our platform helps enterprises aggregate information on any scenario intelligently using AI. For example, you want to be alerted when bank related cybercrime risk in Turkey is high or if there is an increase in oil sanctions breaches in Middle-East? Or set up specific alerts for companies and their CXOs related to money laundering. You can customise and tailor the use case to your specific needs, even down to an event level: UK elections and Brexit? Whoâ€™s in the news and how does it impact you.
