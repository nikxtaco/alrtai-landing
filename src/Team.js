    {/* <p>alrt.ai started almost accidentally following a reddit post on /r/datascience. Long story short, Adarsh was looking for a data science use case for a final year project, Claus saw it, replied, and it took off from there. Adarsh pulled together the founding team and we're working on customising scenarios for news feed analytics to combine and rank stories related to different kinds of entities, then give you alerts, trends, notifications or whatever works for you. In any case, it won't be conventional.</p> */}
